Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the AI Research position at Sentient. Your mission to democratize AI development through decentralized systems strongly resonates with my research experience and technical background.

As a Research Assistant at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA), I am actively investigating solutions for Multi-Modal Large Language Models, with a focus on hallucination reduction and model evaluation. This role has given me hands-on experience with PyTorch, transformer architectures, and designing experimental pipelines for model fine-tuning and evaluation.

My experience includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Implementing and evaluating state-of-the-art LLM architectures
\item Building RAG systems and vector databases for efficient data retrieval
\item Managing AI workflows using cloud platforms (AWS, GCP)
\item Conducting systematic literature reviews on emerging AI research
\end{itemize}

I am particularly drawn to Sentient's emphasis on open-source development and collaborative AI advancement. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to your pioneering work in decentralized AGI.
